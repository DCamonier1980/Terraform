# mnptu Internals

This section covers the internals of mnptu and explains how
plans are generated, the lifecycle of a provider, etc. The goal

We want you to be able to trust and understand what mnptu is
doing to function.

-> **Note:** Knowledge of mnptu internals is not
required to use mnptu. If you aren't interested in the internals
of mnptu, you may safely skip this section.
