# Network Providers

This is a group of network providers that offer specific network capabilities
such and DNS, routing, and firewall configuration.  Terraform integrates with
these services using the specific providers to enable these specialized services
to execute tasks during the provisioning of infrastructure.  These providers are
primarily supported by the vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp, and are
tested by HashiCorp.
