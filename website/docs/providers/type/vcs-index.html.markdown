# Version Control Providers

This is a group of Version Control System (VCS) providers that offer capabilities
of using Terraform to manage your VCS projects, teams and repositories. Terraform
integrates with these services using the specific provider to enable these
specialized configuration abilities. These providers are primarily supported by
the vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp, and are tested by HashiCorp.
