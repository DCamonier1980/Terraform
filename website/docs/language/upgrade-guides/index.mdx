# Upgrading to Terraform v1.4

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.4 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.4 honors the [Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises), but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require additional upgrade steps:
* [Provider caching during `terraform init`](#provider-caching-during-terraform-init)
* [Hostname interpretation during `terraform init`](#hostname-interpretation-during-terraform-init)

See the full [changelog for more details](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.4/CHANGELOG.md). If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not by this guide, or if the migration instructions don't work for you, please start a topic in [the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core/27) to discuss it.

## Provider caching during terraform init

`terraform init` now ignores entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. 

Prior to this change, when installing a new provider for the first time, Terraform could not have determined the full set of checksums to include in the lockfile. This problem is now addressed in this change. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. 

For more details and how to use the prior incorrect behavior, please see the [documentation](/cli/config/config-file#allowing-the-provider-plugin-cache-to-break-the-dependency-lock-file).

## Hostname interpretation during terraform init

When interpreting the hostname portion of a provider source address or the address of a module in a module registry, Terraform will now use non-transitional IDNA2008 mapping rules instead of the transitional mapping rules previously used. Terraform will no longer accept the characters `ß` (U+00DF, "LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S") and `ς` (U+03C2, "GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA"), both of which have alternative forms that must be used instead.

This change is to better adhere to the [the WHATWG URL spec's rules for interpreting non-ASCII domain names](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii). Terraform seeks to remain consistent with how web browsers interpret hostnames. For some hostnames containing non-ASCII characters this may cause Terraform to now request a different "punycode" hostname when resolving.
