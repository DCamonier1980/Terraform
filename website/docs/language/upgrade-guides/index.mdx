# Upgrading to Terraform v1.7

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.7 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.7 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require
additional upgrade steps:
* [Deprecated parameters for the  S3 backend](#s3-backend)

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.6/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## S3 Backend

In Terraform 1.7.0 the S3 backend will begin phasing out the legacy credential chain evaluation order by defaulting `use_legacy_workflow` to `false` and deprecating the argument.
This will bring the default behavior of the backend into alignment with the AWS SDKs and CLI.
The legacy behavior can be preserved by setting this argument to `true`.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # additional configuration omitted for brevity
    use_legacy_workflow = true
  }
}
```

In Terraform 1.8.0 this argument will be removed, and the S3 backend will always use the default AWS SDK for Go credential chain evaluation order.
