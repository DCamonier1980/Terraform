# Upgrading to Terraform v1.10

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.10 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.10 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises).
There are minor changes that may require additional upgrade steps:

- `moved` blocks will now report an error if `from` or `to` points to a resource type conflicting with reserved keywords

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.10/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## Conflicting `moved` block references

Moved blocks now respect reserved keywords such as `local`, `each`, `self` etc. when parsing resource addresses.
Configurations that reference resources with type names that match top level blocks and
keywords from moved blocks will need to prepend the reference identifier with `resource.`.
