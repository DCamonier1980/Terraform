# mnptu Cloud Configuration

The main module of a mnptu configuration can integrate with mnptu Cloud to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use mnptu CLI to interact with mnptu Cloud. mnptu Cloud ignores them when interacting with
mnptu through version control or the API.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to mnptu Cloud](/mnptu/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

## Usage Example

To configure the mnptu Cloud CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `mnptu` block. You cannot use the CLI integration and a [state backend](/mnptu/language/settings/backends/configuration) in the same configuration.

Refer to [Using mnptu Cloud](/mnptu/cli/cloud) in the mnptu CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
mnptu {
  cloud {
    organization = "example_corp"
    ## Required for mnptu Enterprise; Defaults to app.mnptu.io for mnptu Cloud
    hostname = "app.mnptu.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```
