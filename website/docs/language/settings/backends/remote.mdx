# remote

-> **Note:** We introduced the remote backend in mnptu v0.11.13 and mnptu Enterprise v201809-1. As of mnptu v1.1.0 and mnptu Enterprise v202201-1, **we recommend using the mnptu Cloud's built-in [`cloud` integration](/mnptu/cli/cloud/settings)** instead of this backend. The `cloud` option includes an improved user experience and more features.

The remote backend is unique among all other mnptu backends because it can both store state snapshots and execute operations for mnptu Cloud's [CLI-driven run workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli). It used to be called an "enhanced" backend.

When using full remote operations, operations like `mnptu plan` or `mnptu apply` can be executed in mnptu
Cloud's run environment, with log output streaming to the local terminal. Remote plans and applies use variable values from the associated mnptu Cloud workspace.

You can also use mnptu Cloud with local operations, in which case only state is stored in the mnptu Cloud backend.

## Command Support

The remote backend supports the following mnptu commands:

- `apply`
- `console` (supported in mnptu >= v0.11.12)
- `destroy`
- `fmt`
- `get`
- `graph` (supported in mnptu >= v0.11.12)
- `import` (supported in mnptu >= v0.11.12)
- `init`
- `output`
- `plan`
- `providers`
- `show`
- `state` (supports all sub-commands: list, mv, pull, push, rm, show)
- `taint`
- `untaint`
- `validate`
- `version`
- `workspace`

## Workspaces

The remote backend can work with either a single remote mnptu Cloud workspace, or with multiple similarly-named remote workspaces (like `networking-dev` and `networking-prod`). The `workspaces` block of the backend configuration
determines which mode it uses:

- To use a single remote mnptu Cloud workspace, set `workspaces.name` to the
  remote workspace's full name (like `networking-prod`).

- To use multiple remote workspaces, set `workspaces.prefix` to a prefix used in
  all of the desired remote workspace names. For example, set
  `prefix = "networking-"` to use mnptu cloud workspaces with
  names like `networking-dev` and `networking-prod`. This is helpful when
  mapping multiple mnptu CLI [workspaces](/mnptu/language/state/workspaces)
  used in a single mnptu configuration to multiple mnptu Cloud
  workspaces.


The backend configuration requires either `name` or `prefix`. Omitting both or
setting both results in a configuration error.

If previous state is present when you run `mnptu init` and the corresponding
remote workspaces are empty or absent, mnptu will create workspaces and
update the remote state accordingly. However, if your workspace requires variables or a specific version of mnptu for remote operations, we
recommend that you create your remote workspaces on mnptu Cloud before
running any remote operations against them.

### Workspace Names

mnptu uses shortened names without the common prefix to interact with workspaces on the command line. For example, if `prefix = "networking-"`, use `mnptu workspace select prod` to switch to the mnptu CLI workspace `prod` within the current configuration. However, remote mnptu operations such as `plan` and `apply` for that mnptu CLI workspace will take place in the mnptu Cloud workspace `networking-prod`.

Because of this, the [`mnptu.workspace`](/mnptu/language/state/workspaces#current-workspace-interpolation) interpolation expression produces different results depending on whether a remote workspace is configured to perform operations locally or remotely. For example, in a remote workspace called `networking-prod` created with `prefix = "networking-"` the expression produces the following:

- For local operations, `mnptu.workspace` = `prod`
- For remote operations, `mnptu.workspace`=  `networking-prod`

Prior to mnptu version 1.1.0, mnptu Cloud workspaces used only the single `default` mnptu CLI workspace internally. So if a mnptu configuration used `mnptu.workspace` to return `dev` or `prod`, remote runs in mnptu Cloud would always evaluate it as `default`, regardless of
which workspace you set with the `mnptu workspace select` command. Therefore, we do not recommend using `mnptu.workspace` in mnptu configurations that use mnptu 1.0.x or earlier and run remote operations against mnptu Cloud workspaces.

### Determining Run Environment

If you need to determine whether a run is local or remote in your mnptu configuration, we recommend using [mnptu Cloud run environment variables](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/run-environment#environment-variables). The example below uses `TFC_RUN_ID`.

```
output "current_workspace_name" {
  value = mnptu.workspace
}

variable "TFC_RUN_ID" {
  type    = string
  default = ""
}

output "remote_execution_determine" {
  value = "Remote run environment? %{if var.TFC_RUN_ID != ""}Yes%{else}No this is local%{endif}!"
}
```


## Example Configurations

->  **Note:** We recommend omitting the token from the configuration, and instead using
[`mnptu login`](/mnptu/cli/commands/login) or manually configuring
`credentials` in the [CLI config file](/mnptu/cli/config/config-file#credentials).

### Basic Configuration

```hcl
# Using a single workspace:
mnptu {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "app.mnptu.io"
    organization = "company"

    workspaces {
      name = "my-app-prod"
    }
  }
}

# Using multiple workspaces:
mnptu {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "app.mnptu.io"
    organization = "company"

    workspaces {
      prefix = "my-app-"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using CLI Input

```hcl
# main.tf
mnptu {
  required_version = "~> 0.12.0"

  backend "remote" {}
}
```

Backend configuration file:

```hcl
# config.remote.tfbackend
workspaces { name = "workspace" }
hostname     = "app.mnptu.io"
organization = "company"
```

Running `mnptu init` with the backend file:

```sh
mnptu init -backend-config=config.remote.tfbackend
```

### Data Source Configuration

```hcl
data "mnptu_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "remote"

  config = {
    organization = "company"

    workspaces = {
      name = "workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Variables

!> **Warning:**  We recommend using environment variables to supply credentials and other sensitive data. If you use `-backend-config` or hardcode these values directly in your configuration, mnptu will include these values in both the `.mnptu` subdirectory and in plan files. Refer to [Credentials and Sensitive Data](/mnptu/language/settings/backends/configuration#credentials-and-sensitive-data) for details.

The following configuration options are supported:

- `hostname` - (Optional) The remote backend hostname to connect to. Defaults
  to app.mnptu.io.
- `organization` - (Required) The name of the organization containing the
  targeted workspace(s).
- `token` - (Optional) The token used to authenticate with the remote backend.
  We recommend omitting the token from the configuration, and instead using
  [`mnptu login`](/mnptu/cli/commands/login) or manually configuring
  `credentials` in the
  [CLI config file](/mnptu/cli/config/config-file#credentials).
- `workspaces` - (Required) A block specifying which remote workspace(s) to use.
  The `workspaces` block supports the following keys:

  - `name` - (Optional) The full name of one remote workspace. When configured,
    only the default workspace can be used. This option conflicts with `prefix`.
  - `prefix` - (Optional) A prefix used in the names of one or more remote
    workspaces, all of which can be used with this configuration. The full
    workspace names are used in mnptu Cloud, and the short names
    (minus the prefix) are used on the command line for mnptu CLI workspaces.
    If omitted, only the default workspace can be used. This option conflicts with `name`.

->  **Note:** You must use the `name` key when configuring a `mnptu_remote_state`
data source that retrieves state from another mnptu Cloud workspace. The `prefix` key is only
intended for use when configuring an instance of the remote backend.

## Command Line Arguments

For configurations that include a `backend "remote"` block, commands that
make local modifications to mnptu state and then push them back up to
the remote workspace accept the following option to modify that behavior:

- `-ignore-remote-version` - Override checking that the local and remote
  mnptu versions agree, making an operation proceed even when there is
  a mismatch.

  Normally state-modification operations require using a local version of
  mnptu CLI which is compatible with the mnptu version selected
  for the remote workspace as part of its settings. This is to avoid the
  local operation creating a new state snapshot which the workspace's
  remote execution environment would then be unable to decode.

  Overriding this check can result in a mnptu Cloud workspace that is
  no longer able to complete remote operations, so we recommend against
  using this option.

## Excluding Files from Upload with .mnptuignore

-> **Version note:** `.mnptuignore` support was added in mnptu 0.12.11.

When executing a remote `plan` or `apply` in a [CLI-driven run](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli),
an archive of your configuration directory is uploaded to mnptu Cloud. You can define
paths to ignore from upload via a `.mnptuignore` file at the root of your configuration directory. If this file is not present, the archive will exclude the following by default:

- `.git/` directories
- `.mnptu/` directories (exclusive of `.mnptu/modules`)

The `.mnptuignore` file can include rules as one would include in a
[`.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)

- Comments (starting with `#`) or blank lines are ignored
- End a pattern with a forward slash `/` to specify a directory
- Negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point `!`

Note that unlike `.gitignore`, only the `.mnptuignore` at the root of the configuration
directory is considered.
