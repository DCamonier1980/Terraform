# `resource` block

This topic provides reference information about the `resource` block in the Terraform configuration language. 

## Introduction

Add `resource` blocks to your Terraform configuration to describe one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records. Specific arguments that you can define in your configuration depend on the providers you import. 

Refer to the following topics for additional information:

[usage topic about configuring the resource block]()
[usage topic about configuring the provider block]()
[provider block reference]()

## Configuration model

The following list provides an overview of the attributes you can declare in the `resource` block:

`resource "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`
- `<PROVIDER_ARGUMENTS>`
- `count`: number 
- `depends_on`: list
- `for_each`:  map or set of one element
- `provider`: short desc of value
- `lifecycle`: short desc of value
- `provisioner "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"` 

## Specification

This section provides details about the arguments you can configure in the `resource` block. Specific providers and backends may support additional fields.

### `resource`

The main `resource` block accepts the following attributes:

`TYPE`: Specifies the type of resource you can declare depends on the provider you import. Refer to the documentation for your provider for details. You can also specify the `terraform_data` resource type to implement a standard resource lifecycle. Refer [Implement the standard resource lifecycle](linky-link) for additional information
`LABEL`: Specifies an arbitrary name for the resource that you can use to reference the resource from other configuration elements. Refer to [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) in the style guide for label recommendations.

### `PROVIDER_ARGUMENTS`

Specific arguments that you can define in your configuration depend on the providers you import. Refer to the documentation for your provider for details.  
### `resource{}.count`

Meta-argument that instructs Terraform to provision the number of identical resources specified. Additional information. Refer to [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details.   
### `resource{}.depends_on`

### `resource{}.for_each`

### `resource{}.provider`

### `resource{}.lifecycle`

## Examples

The following examples describe common patterns for specific use cases.

### Define an AWS instance

The following example defines an `aws_instance` resource named `web`. 

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
