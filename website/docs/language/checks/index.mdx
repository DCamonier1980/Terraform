# Checks

-> **Note:** Check blocks are only available in Terraform v1.5.0 and later.

The `check` block can validate your infrastructure outside the usual resource lifecycle. Check blocks address a gap between post-apply and functional validation of infrastructure. Check blocks allow you to define [custom conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions) that execute on every Terraform plan or apply operation without affecting the overall status of an operation. Check blocks execute as the last step of a plan or apply, after Terraform has planned or provisioned your infrastructure.

## Checks Syntax

You can declare a `check` block with a local name, zero-to-one scoped [data sources](#scoped-data-sources), and one-to-many [assertions](#assertions).

The following example loads the Terraform website and validates that it returns the expected status code of `200`.

```hcl
check "health_check" {
  data "http" "terraform_io" {
    url = "https://www.terraform.io"
  }

  assert {
    condition = data.http.terraform_io.status_code == 200
    error_message = "${data.http.terraform_io.url} returned an unhealthy status code"
  }
}
```

### Scoped Data Sources

You can use any data source from any provider as a scoped data source within a `check` block.

A `check` block can optionally contain a nested (a.k.a scoped) data source. This `data` block behaves like an external [data source](/terraform/language/data-sources), except you can not reference it outside its enclosing `check` block. Additionally, if a scoped data source's provider raises any errors, they are masked as warnings and do not prevent Terraform from continuing operation execution.

You can use a scoped data source to validate the status of a piece of infrastructure outside of the usual Terraform resource lifecycle. [In the above example](#checks-syntax), if the `terraform_io` data source fails to load, you receive a warning instead of a blocking error, which would occur if you declared this data source outside of a `check` block.

Any data source from any provider can be used within a check block.

#### Meta-Arguments

Scoped data sources support the `depends_on` and `provider` [meta-arguments](/terraform/language/resources/syntax#meta-arguments). Scoped data sources do not support the `count`, `for_each`, or `lifecycle` meta-arguments.

### Assertions

Check blocks validate your custom assertions using `assert` blocks. Each `check` block must have at least one, but potentially many, `assert` blocks. Each `assert` block has a [`condition` attribute](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#condition-expressions) and an [`error_message` attribute](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#error-messages).

Unlike other [custom conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions), assertions do not affect Terraform's execution of an operation. A failed assertion reports a warning without halting the ongoing operation. This contrasts with other custom conditions, such as a postcondition, where Terraform produces an error immediately, halting the operation and blocking the application or planning of future resources.

Condition arguments within `assert` blocks can refer to scoped data sources within the enclosing `check` block and any variables, resources, data sources, or module outputs within the current module.

[Learn more about assertions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#check-assertions).

### Meta-Arguments

Check blocks do not currently support [meta-arguments](/terraform/language/resources/syntax#meta-arguments). We are still collecting feedback on this feature, so if your use case would benefit from check blocks supporting meta-arguments, please let us know. 

## Continuous Validation in Terraform Cloud

Terraform Cloud can automatically validate whether checks in a workspaceâ€™s configuration continue to pass after Terraform provisions new infrastructure. See [Continuous Validation](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health#continuous-validation) for details.

## Choosing Checks or other Custom Conditions

In some cases, you can use checks and [postconditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#preconditions-and-postconditions) interchangeably to validate resources and data sources. 

For example, you can [rewrite the above `check` block example](#checks-syntax) to use a postcondition instead. The below code uses a `postcondition` block to validate that the Terraform website returns the expected status code of `200`.

```hcl
data "http" "terraform_io" {
  url = "https://www.terraform.io"

  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
        condition = self.status_code == 200
        error_message = "${self.url} returned an unhealthy status code"
    }
  }
}
```

Both of our `check` and `postcondition` block examples validate that the Terraform website returns a `200` status code during a plan or an apply operation. The difference between the two blocks is how each handles failure.

If a `postcondition` block fails, it _blocks_ Terraform from continuing execution of the current operation. If a `check` block fails, it _does not_ block Terraform's execution of an operation.

This means that recovering from a failure is impossible with a postcondition as Terraform will block any plan or apply operations as long as the postcondition is unsatisfied during the plan. This problem stems from the postcondition not being directly dependent on the Terraform configuration but instead on the complex interactions between multiple resources.

We recommend using check blocks to validate the status of infrastructure as a whole. We only recommend using postconditions when you want a guarantee on a single resource based on that resource's configuration.
