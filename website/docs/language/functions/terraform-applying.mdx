# The `terraform.applying` symbol

You can use the `terraform.applying` symbol in your configuration to determine if Terraform is currently applying a plan.

Terraform automatically sets `terraform.applying` to `true` when you [apply a plan](/terraform/cli/commands/apply), and `false` during any other phase. The [planning mode](/terraform/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) you apply Terraform in does not affect `terraform.applying`, meaning that even in destroy mode, `terraform.applying` is still set to `true`.

A common example of where `terraform.applying` can be helpful is when you want to use different credentials for planning and applying a Terraform configuration.

```hcl
locals {
  aws_read_role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXX:role/terraform-read"
  aws_write_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXX:role/terraform-full"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"

  assume_role_with_web_identity {
  # Our plan credentials are read-only, so if Terraform is applying a plan then  # we want to use our AWS role that allows us to write.
    role_arn           = terraform.applying ? local.aws_write_role_arn : local.aws_read_role_arn
  }
}
```

The `terraform.applying` symbol is an ephemeral value, meaning it is only available during Terraform operations and Terraform does not write this value to plan or state files. Additionally, you can only reference `terraform.applying` in ephemeral contexts:

* In [ephemeral variables](/terraform/language/values/variables#exclude-values-from-state)  
* In [local values](/terraform/language/values/locals#ephemeral-values)  
* In [ephemeral resources](terraform/language/resources/ephemeral)  
* In [ephemeral outputs](/terraform/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files)
