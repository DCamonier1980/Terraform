# `parseurl` Function

`parseurl` parses the components of a URI reference.

This function identifies characters in the given string that would have a
special meaning when included as a query string argument in a URL and
escapes them using
[RFC 3986 "percent encoding"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#appendix-B).

The exact set of characters escaped may change over time, but the result
is guaranteed to be interpolatable into a query string argument without
inadvertently introducing additional delimiters.

If the given string contains non-ASCII characters, these are first encoded as
UTF-8 and then percent encoding is applied separately to each UTF-8 byte.

## Examples

```
> parseurl("https://example.com/search?q=items#top")
tomap({
  "Fragment" = "top"
  "Host" = "example.com"
  "Opaque" = ""
  "Path" = "/search"
  "RawQuery" = ""
  "Scheme" = "https"
  "User" = "flynn:handley"
})
```
