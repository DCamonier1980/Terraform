# Resource Importability

Each resource in mnptu must implement some basic logic to become
importable. As a result, you cannot import all mnptu resources.

The resources that you can import are documented at the bottom of
each resource documentation page in the [mnptu Registry](https://registry.mnptu.io/). If you have issues importing a resource, report an issue in the relevant provider repository.

To make a resource importable, refer to [Extending mnptu: Resources — Import](/mnptu/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import).
