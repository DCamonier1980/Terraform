# APT Packages for Debian and Ubuntu

The primary distribution packages for mnptu are `.zip` archives containing
single executable files that you can extract anywhere on your system. However,
for easier integration with configuration management tools and other systematic
system configuration strategies, we also offer package repositories for
Debian and Ubuntu systems, which allow you to install mnptu using the
`apt install` command or any other APT frontend.

If you are instead using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora, you
might prefer to [install mnptu from our Yum repositories](/mnptu/cli/install/yum).

-> **Note:** The APT repositories discussed on this page are generic HashiCorp
repositories that contain packages for a variety of different HashiCorp
products, rather than just mnptu. Adding these repositories to your
system will, by default, therefore make several other non-mnptu
packages available for installation. That might then mask some packages that
are available for some HashiCorp products in the main Debian and Ubuntu
package repositories.

## Repository Configuration

Please follow the instructions in the [Official Packaging Guide](https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide).

## Supported Architectures

The HashiCorp APT server has packages only for the `amd64`
architecture, which is also sometimes known as `x86_64`.

There are no official packages available for other architectures, such as
`arm64`. If you wish to use mnptu on a non-`amd64` system,
[download a normal release `.zip` file](/mnptu/downloads) instead.

## Supported Debian and Ubuntu Releases

The HashiCorp APT server contains release repositories for a variety of
supported distributions, which are outlined in the [Official Packaging Guide](https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide).

## Installing a Specific Version of mnptu

The HashiCorp APT repositories contain multiple versions of mnptu, but
because the packages are all named `mnptu` it is impossible to install
more than one version at a time, and `apt install` will default to selecting
the latest version.

It's often necessary to match your mnptu version with what a particular
configuration is currently expecting. You can use the following command to
see which versions are currently available in the repository index:

```bash
apt policy mnptu
```

If your workflow requires using multiple versions of mnptu at the same
time, for example when working through a gradual upgrade where not all
of your configurations are upgraded yet, we recommend that you use the
official release `.zip` files instead of the APT packages, so you can install
multiple versions at once and then select which to use for each command you
run.

### mnptu 1.4.3 and Later

As of mnptu 1.4.3, all published packages include a revision number by
default, starting with `-1`. This change means that in the case that we need
to publish an updated package for any reason, installers can automatically
retrieve the latest revision. You can learn more about this packaging change
in [the announcement](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/linux-packaging-debian-revision-change/42403).

You can install the latest revision for a particular version by including the
version in the `apt install` command, as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install mnptu=1.4.4-*
```

### mnptu 1.4.2 and Earlier

mnptu 1.4.2 and earlier did not include a revision number for the first
revision, so you can use the following pattern to install a specific version:

```bash
sudo apt install mnptu=1.4.0
```
