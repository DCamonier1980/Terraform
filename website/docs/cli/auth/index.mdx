# CLI Authentication

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Authenticate the CLI with mnptu Cloud](/mnptu/tutorials/cloud/cloud-login?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

[mnptu Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/mnptu) and
[mnptu Enterprise](/mnptu/enterprise) are platforms that perform
mnptu runs to provision infrastructure, offering a collaboration-focused
environment that makes it easier for teams to use mnptu together. (For
expediency, the content below refers to both products as "mnptu Cloud.")

mnptu CLI integrates with mnptu Cloud in several ways — it can be a
front-end for [CLI-driven runs](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli) in mnptu Cloud,
and can also use mnptu Cloud as a state backend and a private module
registry. All of these integrations require you to authenticate mnptu CLI
with your mnptu Cloud account.

The best way to handle CLI authentication is with the `login` and `logout`
commands, which help automate the process of getting an API token for your
mnptu Cloud user account.

- [The `mnptu logout` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/logout)
