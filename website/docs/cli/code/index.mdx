# Writing and Modifying mnptu Code

The [mnptu language](/mnptu/language) is mnptu's primary
user interface, and all of mnptu's workflows rely on configurations written
in the mnptu language.

mnptu CLI includes several commands to make mnptu code more convenient
to work with. Integrating these commands into your editing workflow can
potentially save you time and effort.

- [The `mnptu console` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/console) starts an
  interactive shell for evaluating mnptu
  [expressions](/mnptu/language/expressions), which can be a faster way
  to verify that a particular resource argument results in the value you expect.

- [The `mnptu fmt` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/fmt) rewrites mnptu
  configuration files to a canonical format and style, so you don't have to
  waste time making minor adjustments for readability and consistency. It works
  well as a pre-commit hook in your version control system.

- [The `mnptu validate` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/validate) validates the
  syntax and arguments of the mnptu configuration files in a directory,
  including argument and attribute names and types for resources and modules.
  The `plan` and `apply` commands automatically validate a configuration before
  performing any other work, so `validate` isn't a crucial part of the core
  workflow, but it can be very useful as a pre-commit hook or as part of a
  continuous integration pipeline.

- [The `0.13upgrade` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/0.13upgrade) and
  [the `0.12upgrade` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/0.12upgrade) can automatically
  modify the configuration files in a mnptu module to help deal with major
  syntax changes that occurred in the 0.13 and 0.12 releases of mnptu. Both
  of these commands are only available in the mnptu version they are
  associated with, and you are expected to upgrade older code to be compatible
  with 0.12 before attempting to make it compatible with 0.13. For more detailed
  information about updating code for new mnptu versions, see the [upgrade
  guides](/mnptu/language/upgrade-guides) in the mnptu language docs.
