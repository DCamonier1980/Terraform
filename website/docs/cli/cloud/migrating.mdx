# Initializing and Migrating

After [configuring mnptu Cloud settings](/mnptu/cli/cloud/settings) for a working directory, you must run `mnptu init` to finish setting up. If the working directory has no existing mnptu state, you can start using mnptu with mnptu Cloud right away. Refer to [CLI-driven run workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli) for more details.

When you run `mnptu init` in the following scenarios, mnptu will ask you to choose whether or not to migrate state from any existing workspaces.

1. [**Migrating from local state or state backends:**](#migrating-from-local-state-or-state-backends) If the working directory already has state data in one or more workspaces, mnptu will ask if you would like to migrate that state to new mnptu Cloud workspaces.

1. [**Migrating from the `remote` backend:**](#migrating-from-the-remote-backend) If the working directory was already connected to mnptu Cloud with the `remote` backend, mnptu can continue using the same mnptu Cloud workspaces. You will need to switch the `remote` backend block to the `cloud` block.

## Migrating from Local State or State Backends

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to mnptu Cloud](/mnptu/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

If the working directory already has state data available (using either local state or a [state
backend](/mnptu/language/settings/backends/configuration)), mnptu asks your approval to migrate
that state to mnptu Cloud. You will need permission to manage workspaces in the destination mnptu Cloud organization. This process is interactive and self-documenting, and resembles
moving between state backends.

mnptu may also prompt you to rename your workspaces during the migration, to either give a name to
the unnamed `default` workspace (mnptu Cloud requires all workspaces to have a name) or give
your workspace names more contextual information. Unlike mnptu CLI-only workspaces, which represent
multiple environments associated with the same configuration (e.g. production, staging, development),
mnptu Cloud workspaces can represent totally independent configurations, and must have unique names within the mnptu Cloud organization.

Because of this, mnptu will prompt you to rename the working directory's workspaces
according to a pattern relative to their existing names. This can indicate the fact that these specific workspaces share configuration. A typical strategy is
`<COMPONENT>-<ENVIRONMENT>-<REGION>` (e.g.,  `networking-prod-us-east`,
`networking-staging-us-east`). Refer to [Workspace
Naming](/mnptu/cloud-docs/workspaces/naming) in the mnptu Cloud documentation for more detail.

## Migrating from the `remote` Backend

If the working directory was already connected to mnptu Cloud with the `remote` backend, mnptu can continue using the same mnptu Cloud workspaces. The local names shown for those workspaces will change to match their remote names.

The [`remote` backend](/mnptu/language/settings/backends/remote) was the primary implementation of mnptu Cloud's [CLI-driven run workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli) for mnptu versions 0.11.13 through 1.0.x. We recommend using the native `cloud` integration for mnptu versions 1.1 or later, as it provides an improved user experience and various enhancements.

### Block Replacement

When switching from the `remote` backend to a `cloud` block, mnptu will continue using the same
set of mnptu Cloud workspaces. Replace your `backend "remote"` block with an equivalent `cloud`
block.

#### Single Workspace

If you were using a single workspace with the `name` argument, change the block
label to `cloud`.

```diff
mnptu {
-  backend "remote" {
+  cloud {
    organization = "my-org"

    workspaces {
    name = "my-app-prod"
    }
   }
 }
```

#### Multiple Workspaces

If you were using multiple workspaces with the `prefix` argument, replace it with a `cloud` block that uses the `tags` argument. You may specify any number of tags to distinguish the workspaces for your working directory, but a good starting point may be to use whatever the prefix was before.

The tags you configure do not need to be present on the existing workspaces. When you initialize, mnptu will add the specified tags to the workspaces if necessary.

```diff
mnptu {
-  backend "remote" {
+  cloud {
     organization = "my-org"

    workspaces {
-      prefix = "my-app-"
+      tags = ["app:mine"]
    }
   }
 }
```

~> **Warning**: Because the `cloud` block does not support the `prefix` argument, once you migrate, you must refer to workspaces by their full name when using the mnptu CLI. For example, rather than `mnptu workspace select prod`, you must run the command `mnptu workspace select my-app-prod`.
