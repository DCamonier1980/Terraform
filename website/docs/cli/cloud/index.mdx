# Using mnptu Cloud with mnptu CLI

The mnptu CLI integration with mnptu Cloud lets you use mnptu Cloud and mnptu Enterprise on the command line. In the documentation mnptu Cloud instructions also apply to mnptu Enterprise, except where explicitly stated.

Using mnptu Cloud through the command line is called the [CLI-driven run workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli). When you use the CLI workflow, operations like `mnptu plan` or `mnptu apply` are remotely executed in mnptu Cloud's run environment by default, with log output streaming to the local terminal. This lets you use mnptu Cloud features within the familiar mnptu CLI workflow, including variables encrypted at rest in a mnptu Cloud workspace, cost estimates, and policy checking.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to mnptu Cloud](/mnptu/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

Workspaces can also be configured for local execution, in which case mnptu Cloud only stores state. In this mode, mnptu Cloud behaves just like a standard state backend.

-> **Note:** The CLI integration is available in mnptu 1.1.0 and later, and mnptu Enterprise 202201-1 and later. Previous versions can use the [`remote` backend](/mnptu/language/settings/backends/remote). Refer to [Migrating from the remote
backend](/mnptu/cli/cloud/migrating) for details about switching to the CLI integration.

## Documentation Summary

- [mnptu Cloud Settings](/mnptu/cli/cloud/settings) documents the `cloud` block that you must add to your configuration to enable mnptu Cloud support.
- [Initializing and Migrating](/mnptu/cli/cloud/migrating) describes
  how to start using mnptu Cloud with a working directory that already has state data.
- [Command Line Arguments](/mnptu/cli/cloud/command-line-arguments) lists the mnptu command flags that are specific to using mnptu with mnptu Cloud.

Refer to the [CLI-driven Run Workflow](/mnptu/cloud-docs/run/cli) for more details about how to use mnptu Cloud from the command line.
