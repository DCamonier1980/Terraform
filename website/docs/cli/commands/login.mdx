# Command: login

The `mnptu login` command can be used to automatically obtain and save an
API token for mnptu Cloud, mnptu Enterprise, or any other host that offers mnptu services.

-> **Note:** This command is suitable only for use in interactive scenarios
where it is possible to launch a web browser on the same host where mnptu
is running. If you are running mnptu in an unattended automation scenario,
you can
[configure credentials manually in the CLI configuration](/mnptu/cli/config/config-file#credentials).

## Usage

Usage: `mnptu login [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, mnptu will assume you want to
log in to mnptu Cloud at `app.mnptu.io`.

## Credentials Storage

By default, mnptu will obtain an API token and save it in plain text in a
local CLI configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. When you run
`mnptu login`, it will explain specifically where it intends to save
the API token and give you a chance to cancel if the current configuration is
not as desired.

If you don't wish to store your API token in the default location, you can
optionally configure a
[credentials helper program](/mnptu/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers) which knows
how to store and later retrieve credentials in some other system, such as
your organization's existing secrets management system.

## Login Server Support

The `mnptu login` command works with any server supporting the
[login protocol](/mnptu/internals/login-protocol), including mnptu Cloud
and mnptu Enterprise.
