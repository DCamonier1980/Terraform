# Command: push

!> **Important:** The `mnptu push` command is no longer functional. We recommend the [mnptu Cloud CLI integration](/mnptu/cli/cloud) instead, which allows you to run remote operations in mnptu Cloud directly from the command line.

The `mnptu push` command was an early implementation of remote mnptu runs. It allowed teams to push a configuration to a remote run environment in a discontinued version of mnptu Enterprise.

The legacy mnptu Enterprise version that supported `mnptu push` is no longer available, and there are no remaining instances of that version in operation. Without a service to push to, the command is now completely non-functional.
