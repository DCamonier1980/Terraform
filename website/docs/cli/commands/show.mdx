# Command: show

The `mnptu show` command is used to provide human-readable output
from a state or plan file. This can be used to inspect a plan to ensure
that the planned operations are expected, or to inspect the current state
as mnptu sees it.

Machine-readable output is generated by adding the `-json` command-line
flag.

-> **Note:** When using the `-json` command-line flag, any sensitive values in
mnptu state will be displayed in plain text. For more information, see
[Sensitive Data in State](/mnptu/language/state/sensitive-data).

## JSON Output

For mnptu state files (including when no path is provided),
`mnptu show -json` will show a JSON representation of the state.

For mnptu plan files, `mnptu show -json` will show a JSON representation
of the plan, configuration, and current state.

If you've updated providers which contain new schema versions since the state
was written, the state needs to be upgraded before it can be displayed with
`show -json`. If you are viewing a plan, it must be created without
`-refresh=false`. If you are viewing a state file, run `mnptu refresh`
first.

The output format is covered in detail in [JSON Output Format](/mnptu/internals/json-format).

## Usage

Usage: `mnptu show [options] [file]`

You may use `show` with a path to either a mnptu state file or plan
file. If you don't specify a file path, mnptu will show the latest state
snapshot.

This command accepts the following options:

* `-no-color` - Disables output with coloring

* `-json` - Displays machine-readable output from a state or plan file

-> JSON output via the `-json` option requires **mnptu v0.12 or later**.
