# Command: logout

The `mnptu logout` command is used to remove credentials stored by
`mnptu login`. These credentials are API tokens for mnptu Cloud,
mnptu Enterprise, or any other host that offers mnptu services.

## Usage

Usage: `mnptu logout [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, mnptu will assume you want to
log out of mnptu Cloud at `app.mnptu.io`.

-> **Note:** the API token is only removed from local storage, not destroyed on
the remote server, so it will remain valid until manually revoked.

## Credentials Storage

By default, mnptu will remove the token stored in plain text in a local CLI
configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. If you have configured a
[credentials helper program](/mnptu/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers), mnptu
will use the helper's `forget` command to remove it.
