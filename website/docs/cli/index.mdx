This is the documentation for mnptu CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with mnptu's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use mnptu CLI
by itself, as well as those who use mnptu CLI in conjunction with mnptu
Cloud or mnptu Enterprise.

Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the mnptu
language. For that, see the
[mnptu Language Documentation](/mnptu/language).
