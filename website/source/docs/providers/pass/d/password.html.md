# pass\_password

Reads arbitrary data from a given path in Pass.

~> **Important** All data retrieved from Pass will be
written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```
data "pass_password" "rundeck_auth" {
  path = "secret/rundeck_auth"
}

# Rundeck Provider, for example
provider "rundeck" {
  url        = "http://rundeck.example.com/"
  auth_token = "${data.pass_password.rundeck_auth.data["auth_token"]}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The full logical path from which to request data.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `data_raw` - A string containing the full data payload retrieved from
Pass.

* `data` - A mapping whose keys are the top-level data keys returned from
Pass and whose values are the corresponding values. This map can only
represent string data, so any non-string values returned from Pass are
serialized as JSON.
