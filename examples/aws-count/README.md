# Count Example

The count parameter on resources can simplify configurations
and let you scale resources by simply incrementing a number.

Additionally, variables can be used to expand a list of resources
for use elsewhere.

To run, set the environment variables as below with correct values

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="..."

run `terraform apply` to see it work.
